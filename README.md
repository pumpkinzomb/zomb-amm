# Zomb-AMM

## Decription  
This repository is a added amm module on cosmos-sdk.
I followed B-harvest's lectures of create-amm-module named chaos.

## Important Check point  
I faced a lot of protobuf generating issues during this lectures.  

1. must use [protoc-gen-grpc-gateway@v1.16.0](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/tree/v1.16.0)  
2. must use [protoc-gen-cosmos](https://github.com/regen-network/cosmos-proto)  

## How to start  
I made a start script at root. Just use `sh start.sh`
